				<p class="text-aablue font-weight-bold">WHAT IS A. A. ?</p>
				<p>&emsp; Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.</p>
				<p>&emsp; The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for AA membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions. AA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="text-aablue font-weight-bold">WHAT DOES A. A. DO?</p>
				<ol class="text-justify">
				  <li>A.A. members share their experience with anyone seeking help with a drinking problem; they give person-to-person service or “sponsorship” to the alcoholic coming to A.A. from any source.</li>
				  <li>The A.A. programme, set forth in our Twelve Steps, offers the alcoholic a way to develop a satisfying life without alcohol.</li>
				  <li>This programme is discussed at A.A. group meetings : 

					<ol class="text-justify">
					  <li>Open speaker meetings-open to alcoholics and non alcoholics. (Attendance at an open A.A. meeting is the best way to learn what A.A. is, what it does, and what it does not do.) At speaker meetings, A.A. members “tell their stories.” They describe their experiences with alcohol, how they came to A.A., and how their lives have changed as a result of A.A.</li>
					  <li>Open discussion meetings-one member speaks briefly about his or her drinking experience, and then leads a discussion on A.A. recovery or any drinking-related problem anyone brings up.(Closed meetings are for A.A.s or anyone who may have a drinking problem.</li>
					  <li>Closed discussion meetings-conducted just as open discussions are, but for alcoholics or prospective A.A.s only.</li>
					  <li>Step meetings (usually closed)-discussion of one of the Twelve Steps.</li>
					  <li>A.A. members also take meetings into correctional and treatment facilities.</li>
					  <li>A.A. members may be asked to conduct the informational meetings about A.A. as a part of A.S.A.P. (Alcohol Safety Action Project) and D.W.I. (Driving While Intoxicated) programme. These meetings about A.A. are not regular A.A. group meetings.</li>
					</ol> 
				  </li>
				</ol> 
				<hr>
				<p class="text-aablue font-weight-bold">WHAT A.A. DOES NOT DO?</p>
				<ol class="text-justify">
				  <li>Furnish initial motivation for alcoholics to recover.</li>
				  <li>Solicit members.</li>
				  <li>Engage in or sponsor research.</li>
				  <li>Keep attendance records or case histories.</li>
				  <li>Join “councils” of social agencies.</li>
				  <li>Follow up or try to control its members.</li>
				  <li>Make medical or psychological diagnoses or prognoses.</li>
				  <li>Provide drying-out or nursing services, hospitalization, drugs, or any medical or psychiatric treatment.</li>
				  <li>Offer religious services.</li>
				  <li>Engage in education about alcohol.</li>
				  <li>Provide housing, food, clothing, jobs, money, or any other welfare or social services.</li>
				  <li>Provide domestic or vocational counselling.</li>
				  <li>Accept any money for its services, or any contributions from non-A.A. sources.</li>
				  <li>Provide letters of reference to parole boards, lawyers, court officials, social agencies, employers, etc.</li>
				</ol>
				<hr>
				<p class="text-aablue font-weight-bold">CONCLUSION</p>
				<p>&emsp; The primary purpose of A.A. is to carry our message of recovery to the alcoholic seeking help. Almost every alcoholism treatment tries to help the alcoholic maintain sobriety. Regardless of the road we follow, we all head for the same destination, recovery of the alcoholic person. Together, we can do what none of us could accomplish alone. We can serve as a source of personal experience and be an ongoing support system for recovering alcoholics.</p>
